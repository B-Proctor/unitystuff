Introduction
This document explains how to use the optimized Main Menu script in your Unity project. The script creates a feature-rich main menu for your game, including buttons for playing, accessing options, viewing credits, and exiting the game.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

Unity installed on your computer.
A Unity project where you want to implement the main menu.
The provided optimized Main Menu script (or a similar script) added to your project.
Integrating the Script
Open your Unity project.

Locate or create a GameObject that represents your main menu. This GameObject will hold the Main Menu script and UI elements.

Attach the "MainMenu" script to your main menu GameObject:

Select the GameObject.
In the Inspector window, click the "Add Component" button.
Type "Main Menu" in the search bar and select the script from the list.
Configure the script by assigning the necessary UI elements and panels:

Buttons: Assign the UI buttons for Play, Options, Credits, and Exit.
Panels: Assign the GameObjects representing the main menu, options, credits, and exit confirmation panels.
Scene Name: Enter the name of the scene you want to load when the "Play" button is pressed.
Configuring the Menu
Customize the UI Elements:

Select the UI buttons for Play, Options, Credits, and Exit in the Unity Editor.
Customize the button text, appearance, and behavior to match your game's design.
Customize the Panels:

Customize the appearance and content of the main menu, options, credits, and exit confirmation panels to align with your game's style.
Script Usage
The optimized Main Menu script provides the following functionality:

Play: Loads the specified scene when the "Play" button is pressed.

Options: Displays the Options panel while hiding other panels.

Credits: Displays the Credits panel while hiding other panels.

Exit: Displays an exit confirmation panel to prevent accidental exits. Users can confirm or cancel the exit.

Back to Main Menu: Allows users to return to the main menu from other screens, such as Options and Credits.

Confirm Exit: Quits the application when the "Yes" button in the exit confirmation panel is pressed.

Cancel Exit: Returns to the main menu when the exit confirmation is canceled.

Testing the Main Menu
Save your project and scene.

Click the "Play" button in the Unity Editor to enter Play mode.

Test the functionality of your main menu by interacting with the buttons and panels. Verify that menus are displayed correctly, the game can be started, and the exit confirmation works as expected.

Debug any issues or make further customizations as needed.
